# Installation

Download this repository.
Inside the main folder (allegro-coding-challenge), run the following command:

### `npm install`

to install all dependencies, then run the following command:

### `npm start`

to run the application.
The application should run on the 'http://localhost:3000/' url.

# Additional notes

GitHub doesn't allow server-side sorting option. 
Therefore, to sort an array of repositories, there is a need of fetching all repositories and sort them locally.
This is not a problem while fetching a user with small amount of repositories.

However, fetching a user with a greater amount of repositories can take some time 
(approximately 100 repositories per second).

Therefore, sorting, as well as pagination, works only locally. 

There is also a request counter fetched from a GitHub api.
Unauthenticated users can only make 60 requests (fetching 100 repositories in small amount of time counts as about 1 fetch)
in some specific amount of time (about half an hour).

Sometimes, if the request limit is about to be filled, repositories fetching can be interrupted,
so only part of all repositories are actually fetched into the app, showed and sorted.
Specific info is given in the browser console ( fetched / maxToFetch).





# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
